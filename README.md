# badger: tracking your data stochastically

### Hey, what are you doing?

This app pings the user at random points in the day and asks what they are currently doing, where they select from a bunch of tags (ex. exercise, homework, TV, etc). Over time, it will collect data and provide a visualization based on your activities. The user will be able to view old data through the RESTful API.
